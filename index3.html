		All technical revolutions lead to social transformation.  

Nowadays we are witnessing another revolution within the technological realm: that of Machine Learning and its trained models that are files “taught” to recognize patterns that serve to explain our reality. Yet these are largely biased data-sets. 

We can ask if we should we be supportive of this merciless quantification of reality - at the very least, we need to take a critical stance. Hence the necessity of other data, thus fighting against the monoculture that produces models that can be "opinions embedded in mathematics.” 
	<b>The <i>Singing Rivers</i> project uses the analogy of the "talking river" (as the Rimac river in Peru is known, where such Quechua word means "speech") contributing to these multiplicity of voices by training popular Machine Learning models with datasets that prioritize other peoples and cultures, in this case, linked to the Amazonia and its water channels that have been communication channels traditionally. </b>

<b>By clicking on the map, you will be able to visualize how rivers connected to the Amazonas river and its surrounding areas have changed since the 70s. At this stage, Machine Learning becomes a tool that allows us to “fill in the gaps,” recreating missing data from scattered frames. In this way, we can clearly understand how the area has transformed, alongside the river bed itself, for the last 50 years.</b>
